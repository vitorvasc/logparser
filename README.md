# Logparser

## About the application

Logparser is a simple application built using [Go](https://go.dev/) that reads a log file generated by [Quake 3 Arena Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena) and extracts useful informations for each match.

## How to run

To run the application, you need to have [Go](https://go.dev/) version >= 1.21 installed on your machine. After that, you can run the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

The application will be executed on your console, using a simple CLI (command line interface) showing a simple menu with the following options:

```text
1. Process log file and load matches
2. Generate report by game number
3. Generate report by game number, including deaths by cause
4. Generate complete report (all games, including deaths by cause)
9. Exit 
```

### Option 1: Process log file and load matches

When you select the first option, the application will search and load the log file stored on `resources/qgames.log`. This path is defined by the const `LogFileLocation` on the file `cmd/main.go`.

### Option 2: Generate report by game number

When you select the second option, the application will ask for the game number you want to generate the report. After that, it will show the following information:

```json
{
  "game_9": {
    "total_kills": 67,
    "players": [
      "Oootsimo",
      "Dono da Bola",
      "Zeh",
      "Chessus",
      "Mal",
      "Assasinu Credi"
    ],
    "kills": {
      "Assasinu Credi": 8,
      "Chessus": 11,
      "Dono da Bola": 2,
      "Mal": 6,
      "Oootsimo": 8,
      "Zeh": 15
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Generate report by game number, including deaths by cause

This type of report generates the details for the chosen match number. The result will be similar to the previous option, but with the additional information for deaths by cause. The result will be similar to the following example:

```json
TBD
```

### Option 4: Generate complete report (all games, including deaths by cause)

This type of report generates the details for all matches. The result will be similar to the previous option, but containing the information for all matches. The result will be similar to the following example:

```json
TBD
```
